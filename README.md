# Traditional use of medicinal plants in Canada

## Rationale

The paper:

> Uprety Y, Asselin H, Dhakal A, Julien N. 2012. Traditional use of medicinal plants in the boreal forests of Canada: review and perspectives. J Ethnobiol Ethnomed. 2012;9:7. doi: [10.1186/1746-4269-8-7](10.1186/1746-4269-8-7).

... contains a [fantastic dataset](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3316145/) in the supplementary data about the traditional medicinal use and vernacular names of plants in Canada. The paper (and thus supplementary data) are published under [Creative Commons Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0).

The data however are provided as a Word file and thus not readily usable. The goal of this repository is to format the data as a csv and link the data up with the [Database of Vascular Plants of Canada (VASCAN)](http://data.canadensys.net/vascan/), in which I am [involved](https://github.com/peterdesmet/vascan-data-paper).
